# Hi there! 👋 I'm Kristopher Roller.

Also known as akjroller or awakengaming83, I'm a Computer Science student with a strong passion for coding and tech innovation, especially in the realm of Discord bot development.

## 🎮 Current Project: Diablo 4 Events Tracker (D4ET)
My standout project at the moment is the [`Diablo 4 Event Tracker (D4ET)`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1118297246379806781&permissions=2147568640&scope=bot%20applications.commands). This Discord bot is designed for the Diablo 4 gaming community, providing real-time alerts for various in-game events.

D4ET is currently active on over **2,600 Discord servers**, serving more than **250,000 users**, and has successfully sent over **2.5M alerts**! 

It enhances the gaming experience by ensuring players never miss important events and outperforms other similar bots in terms of speed and reliability.

## 🚀 Future Plans for D4ET
While D4ET already provides a significant amount of value to the Diablo 4 community, I'm continuously looking for ways to improve and expand its features. I'm keen on further refining its performance and exploring new functionalities that can be added. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
