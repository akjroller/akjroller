# Hello there! 👋
I'm Kristopher Roller, a first-year computer science student passionate about programming and technology.

## 📚 What I'm currently learning
I'm currently honing my skills in Python, diving into the world of RESTful APIs, and uncovering the fascinating domain of Data Science. I'm especially interested in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how it can reveal hidden patterns and insights in data. I'm working on projects that aim to strengthen my understanding of these concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ My Projects
My primary repository at the moment is [`collatz-conjecture-explorer`](https://github.com/akjroller/collatz-conjecture-explorer). It's a computational service and API for exploring and understanding the Collatz Conjecture. This project continuously calculates Collatz sequences from any given number and stores the results in a SQLite database for further exploration.

## 💡 What I'm up to
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and concepts, eager to apply what I learn to my projects. Right now, I'm diving deeper into data science, particularly exploratory data analysis, and learning more about building and working with RESTful APIs. I'm also excited about the possibility of integrating machine learning into my future projects. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
