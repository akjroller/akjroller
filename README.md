# Hello there! 👋
I'm Kristopher Roller, a first-year computer science student passionate about programming and technology.

## 📚 What I'm currently learning
I'm currently improving my skills in Python and exploring the fascinating world of algorithms. I'm working on projects that can help me strengthen my understanding of concepts learned in class.

## 🛠️ My Projects
My primary repository at the moment is `collatz-conjecture-explorer`. It's a computational service and API for exploring and understanding the Collatz Conjecture. This project continuously calculates Collatz sequences from any given number and stores the results in a SQLite database for further exploration.

## 💡 What I'm up to
In the past year, I've made 22 contributions to my projects. I enjoy dedicating time to improve my code and learning new things along the way.
